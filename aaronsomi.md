# Interest of content:
Outstanding, a wide variety of interesting topics.
# Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
Very good, as every page is visually identical in layout, with the exception of the medical page, which has a random search bar. However, the visual style is a little colourless and bland.
# Quality of written presentation:
Outstanding, it is well-written without spelling errors or incorrect grammar.
# Validity of HTML:
Weak, I found 3 HTML errors on Communication, 1 on FT, 4 on the Medical page and none on the Home page
# Evidence of collaboration:
Good, as Dan and Fuad have had their authour sections completed by someone else, however whoever wrote the Finacial Technology page is not credited properly.
